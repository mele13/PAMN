# CodeLabs: Data Persistence
This set of CodeLabs includes guided us on how to store data locally on an Android device and ensure apps work seamlessly, even in the face of network interruptions. The goal is to provide a smooth and consistent user experience.

## Introduction to SQL
The objective of this exercise is to learn how to use SQL to read and manipulate data in a relational database, which is a fundamental skill for local data management in Android apps.

## Using Room for Data Persistence
The objective of this exercise is to show you how to employ the Room library, which simplifies the creation and use of relational databases in Android apps, enabling effective data persistence.

## Storing and Accessing Data with DataStore
The objective of this exercise is to learn how to store simple key-value pair data using Preferences DataStore in an Android app, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Overall Experience
The overall experience of using Room in Kotlin for Android development was positive. Room provided a simplified and convinient way to handle data persistence in Android apps. Altough I still find it easier to just use common databases such as MySQL, MongoDB or even Firebase (e.g. image storage).
