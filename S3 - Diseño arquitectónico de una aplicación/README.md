# Architectural design of an application

This report outlines the architectural design of a mobile application for Sirius Animal Shelter. The primary aim of this application is to facilitate animal adoption and sponsorship management, catering to both shelter staff and general users interested in supporting the cause. It presents an extensive range of features, including user management, exploring animals available for adoption, individual animal profiles, medical record management, event and news updates, user role-based communication, invoice management, volunteer role-based access levels, guided adoption and sponsorship processes, volunteer availability tracking, donation capabilities, and support for multiple languages.

The chosen architecture for the application is the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It provides efficient separation between presentation logic and business logic, enhancing modularity, ease of maintenance, scalability, and dynamic data binding. The report details the key elements of the MVVM architecture, such as the Model (Backend), View (Frontend), and ViewModel (Intermediary), and explains how they interact.

Two essential use cases are presented: user registration and searching for animals available for adoption. These cases demonstrate how the MVVM architecture effectively manages user interactions and data flow within the application.

The report concludes that the MVVM architecture aligns with the project's objectives of modularity, maintainability, and a user-friendly interface. It assures the team that this architecture will support the successful development of the application, delivering an exceptional user experience. Other architectural options, such as MVC, MVP, MVI, and Hexagonal, were considered but deemed less suitable for the project's scope and complexity.
