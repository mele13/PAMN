# CodeLabs: Your first Android app
This set of CodeLabs includes three exercises aimed at providing an introduction to Android development using Kotlin and Android Studio.

## Learning Android Studio
The goal of this exercise is to gain experience in Android Studio by creating a straightforward Android app that displays the user's name.

## Creating a Birthday Greeting Card
The objective of this exercise is to learn how to design a birthday greeting card app for Android. The focus is on crafting a visually appealing and interactive birthday card within the Android Basics in Compose course, while exploring the fundamentals of using Compose to design a personalized birthday card.

## Creating a Business Card App
The objective of this exercise is to develop a business card app as part of the Android Basics in Compose course. The goal of the project is to apply Compose knowledge to create a user-friendly application for displaying and sharing contact information. Upon completing the project, hands-on experience in building a practical app that can be used for sharing personal or professional details with others is gained.

# Reflection on the CodeLabs Experience
In my opinion, the CodeLabs experience has been relatively straightforward. Having prior experiences with programming in various languages and frameworks, I found many commonalities in the Android development process. However, there were still notable takeaways:

## Positive Aspects
1. Modularization -> I appreciated the emphasis on modularizing code. It enhances code organization and maintainability, making it easier to manage larger projects.
2. Custom Images and Icons -> The ability to incorporate custom images and icons into the app design was a significant advantage. It allowed for a personalized touch and more visually appealing user interface.
3. UI Element Placement -> Aligning UI elements wasn't too challenging, particularly if you have previous experience with web development and CSS. The principles of layouts and positioning have similarities, which made it easier to grasp.

## Technical Difficulties
I encountered a technical issue during the course that required me to make a modification in the 'build.gradle.kts' file located in 'gradle scripts.' Specifically, I had to change the 'compileSdk' version from 33 to 34 due to an SDK error. This happened even though I created a new project for every exercise.

## Overall Experience
Throughout the CodeLabs tutorial, I found instances where the content, while well-structured and suitable for beginners, became somewhat monotonous and less engaging, particularly for more experienced users.
